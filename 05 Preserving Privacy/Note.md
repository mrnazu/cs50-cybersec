# Preserving Privacy

Note: Nazu

## Privacy

* Privacy is the ability to control the flow of information about oneself.
* Preserving privacy is crucial in the digital age, as our personal data is constantly being collected and shared.

## Data Minimization

* The principle of data minimization states that you should only collect and store the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve your goals.
* Examples:
	+ A website doesn't need to store your entire browsing history; it only needs to know your login credentials.
	+ A social media platform doesn't need to store your entire phonebook; it only needs to know your friends' names.

## Data Protection

* Data protection involves ensuring that data is stored securely and only accessible to authorized individuals.
* Examples:
	+ Using encryption to protect data at rest and in transit.
	+ Using access controls (e.g., passwords, biometrics) to restrict access to sensitive data.
	+ Regularly backing up data to prevent loss or corruption.

## Anonymity

* Anonymity is the ability to remain unknown or unidentifiable.
* Techniques for maintaining anonymity:
	+ Using pseudonyms or handles online.
	+ Encrypting data to make it unreadable to unauthorized parties.
	+ Using proxy servers or VPNs to mask your IP address.

## Privacy-Respecting Design

* Designing systems with privacy in mind from the beginning can help protect users' privacy.
* Examples:
	+ Using end-to-end encryption for messaging apps.
	+ Implementing "opt-in" consent models for data collection.
	+ Providing clear and transparent privacy policies.

## Privacy Laws and Regulations

* Various laws and regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA, aim to protect individuals' privacy.
* Understanding and complying with these regulations is crucial for organizations handling sensitive data.
